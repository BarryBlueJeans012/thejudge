PathHolder has four methods and a no arg constructor:

getFileName()
    returns the fileName given to the PathHolder object
getHomeDirectory()
    returns the homedirectory for the machine the PathHolder object was created on
getProjectDirectory()
    returns the thejudge project directory filepath
getWorkingDirectory()
    returns the working directory filepath

PathHolder was created as a class to hold these variables and their getters for its children classes:
fileName
homeDirectory
projectDirectory
workingDirectory

FileRunWithProcessBuilder has three methods and a constructor, it is a child of PathHolder:

FileRunWithProcessBuilder(String fileName)

compile()
    compiles the java source code file in $HOME/judge_boy/fileName
run()
    runs the compiled .class file
runMultiple()
    runs the compiled.class file multiple times, reading a new line from an input file each time,
    until there are no more lines in the input file.
cleanOut()
    deletes the .class files from the $HOME/judge_boy/out/ folder

Each instance of FileRunWithProcessBuilder will only compile and run the given source code file.
To run multiple source files you'll need to create an instance of FileRunWithProcessBuilder for each source file.

Checker has three methods and a constructor, it is a child of PathHolder:

Checker(String classTested)

getOutputFile()
    returns the filepath for the output file to be checked
getAnswerFile()
    returns the filepath for the answer file to be checked against
checkCorrect()
    compares the output file and the answer file and returns how many lines match

Checker, similar to FileRunWithProcessBuilder, will only check one input and one output file, in order to check
multiple sets of files, you'll need to create a new checker object for each set of files.
