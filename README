FileRunWithProcessBuilder has three methods and a constructor:

FileRunWithProcessBuilder(String fileName)

compile()
    compiles the java source code file in $HOME/judge_boy/fileName
run()
    runs the compiled .class file
cleanOut()
    deletes the .class files from the $HOME/judge_boy/out/ folder

Each instance of FileRunWithProcessBuilder will only compile and run the given source code file.
To run multiple source files you'll need to create an instance of FileRunWithProcessBuilder for each source file.
